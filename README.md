OSC-Demos
=========


A collection of simple projects meant to show off the use of OSC.




AnimatedBookCover
-----------------

This requires the [AnimataP5-ng](https://github.com/Neurogami/AnimataP5-ng) library.

It works as the target of an [osc-scripter](https://github.com/Neurogami/osc-scripter) script.

You can see this is action in the videos [An Intro to osc-scripter, Part 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcOrADVDLo4) and  [osc-repl: A helper tool for Open Sound Control (OSC)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mVJs42Q_Js).

Run by itself, the handsome wiggly fellow on the book cover shoud shimmy about.

There are `osc-scripter` scripts to drive assorted animations of the pink background waves.

Each of these ends with the `.oscr` file extension.



Landscape
---------

This requires the [AnimataP5-ng](https://github.com/Neurogami/AnimataP5-ng) library.

That will get it running, but the real fun is when it is the target of an [osc-scripter](https://github.com/Neurogami/osc-scripter) script or two.

Hack your world.

Live curious.
